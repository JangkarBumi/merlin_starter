# Merlin Starter Pack

> Create apps with MERN stack

## Quick Start

```bash
# Install dependencies for back-end
npm install

# Install dependencies for front-end
npm run client-install

# Run the client & server with concurrently
npm run dev

# Run the Express server only
npm run server

# Run the React client only
npm run client

# Server runs on http://localhost:5000 and client on http://localhost:3000
```

## Potential problem
If CRA won't start just create .env file with
```bash
SKIP_PREFLIGHT_CHECK=true
```

### What's in it
#### Server
* express ==> main web framework for backend
* express-validator ==>data validation, check missing field for post
* bcryptjs  => password encryption
* config  ==> global variable
* gravatar ==> avatar profile image
* jsonwebtoken => token for auth
* mongoose => layer on top database so we can interact
* request => make http request to another API : for reading github repo

#### Client

* axios  ==> to make http request, you could use the fetch api but axios for global header

* react-router-dom
* redux
* react-redux
* redux-thunk => middle ware that allow us to to asynchronous request in our action
* redux-devtools-extension
* moment ==> date time format library

concurrently => allow us to run backend & front end at the same time
